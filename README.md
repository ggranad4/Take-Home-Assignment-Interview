### Memory Leak Problem

I took a ton of time understanding what things meant. I had zero to no clue about what any of the code consisted of but i wanted to take the opportunity to put myself in an uncomfortable spot to see if my JS expereince can carry me in finding the issue in the code. But doing this was no help since i didnt understand at first what arrayBuffer was and all the other methods were attempting to do. I wrote a ton of comments on this section to basically not only save what i learned but also to jot down any notes or things that can help me better understand the code. Once i grasped what was going on. My mind first looked at the timeout thinking this was an easy solution and to clearTimeout since it was somehow still in the event loop somehow. But this was not the problem instead it was the sneaky reference of the original segment list. When we created var segment = segmentList[index] we were both pointing to the segment needed but also the reference so adding arrayBuffer to segment also updated the referece to segmentList. Creating arrayBuffer on that segment as well in the list. The tricky part was it was hard to catch when reading appendBuffer it looks like it safely removed the segment and removes it from memory. Almost like blocking the old reference from the list. I caught this by simply console logging what the segment list looked like after every iteration and I could see "arrayBuffer" being added to the segment inside of the original segmentList. Which was the cause of memory constantly growing. This is a classic reference problem in JavaScript. So I made a deep copy making sure that any changes made to this deep copy was not changing the old reference. Another approach I saw that worked and probably could go with my current soltion is after every iteration before segmentIndex++ we could segmentList[segmentIndex] = null and completely remove it from the old array as well but I was thinking that if in the future we want to use that segmentList again this would make it impossible.
