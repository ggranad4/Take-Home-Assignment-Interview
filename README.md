### Query an Ordered List

The main hint in this problem was first in the code we are handed the knownLength. On top of that reading the sentence ordered list gave me right away divide-conquer. Since we always started at 0 and no other checks, index++ I knew any approach would be better than this one.

My first idea was just seeing if checking the middle point would make a difference (middle index is the position above or below and change the starting point of tryNext) (did not). My other idea was to confirm that the time stamp was even in the list. (Not sure if this was necessary since it was 2000 always) but wanted to mimic a real approach to save some time and avoid any unnecessary calls. Lastly, dividing down the middle every call and attempting to get as close as possible to the index was the best approach. Reduced all the unnecessary calls. My main struggle with the problem was I kept returning result from data rather than the whole resolved data. Causing my console to constantly tell me false for all the positions it was looking for. Once i got the binary search down i would simply always either return the inded of the matched posiiton or an index close enough to actually confirm its inside the list. Using this approach and comparing it to the original dropped it significatly. But honeslty I wanted to try my best to make it even easier and readable so I basically created another approach. This approach was still on the brute forcey side but still better than starting from zero and ++ through the list. Instead I stepped through the list 250 times. Checked that index and if the posiiton was above this do another 250 steps until the positon was below that and starting there. binary search still blew this out the water but wanted to attempt to make something super super readable at first glace.
